## Tool notes and directive index

**Purpose:** TOOLS.md serves as a quick reference for tool usage and an index to detailed directives. Rather than loading all procedures into context, keep TOOLS.md light and pull specific directives when needed.

```markdown
# TOOLS.md - Directive Index

Pull the relevant directive before acting. Don't load all of them.

---

## Directives

- `directives/messaging.md` — sending messages on behalf of user
- `directives/databases.md` — local database connections
- `directives/calendar-email.md` — calendar and email integrations
- `directives/[tool-name].md` — specific tool instructions

---

## Quick IDs (always needed)

| Who/What | ID |
|----------|-----|
| User (Platform) | [ID] |
| Primary Channel | [Channel ID] |
| [Other key IDs] | [Values] |

---

## Key Paths

| Resource | Path |
|----------|------|
| Workspace | `~/[workspace]/` |
| Credentials | `~/.moltbot/credentials/` |
| State files | `~/.moltbot/state/` |
| Scripts | `~/.moltbot/scripts/` |

---

## CLI Preferences

- **Always use `rg` over `grep`** — faster
- **Always use `trash` over `rm`** — recoverable
- [Other tool preferences]

---

## [Section for frequently-needed info]

[Quick reference tables, IDs, paths that you need often]
```

**Key patterns:**

- Index structure — point to files rather than including content
- Quick IDs table — frequently-needed identifiers
- Key paths table — where things live
- CLI preferences — consistent tool choices

## Directive Structure

Directives in the `directives/` folder should be:

- **Self-contained** — everything needed to do the task
- **Step-by-step** — clear procedures, not just descriptions
- **Example-rich** — show actual commands, not just concepts
- **Current** — update when tools or procedures change

## Why This Structure?

Loading all tool instructions into every session wastes context. Instead:

- **TOOLS.md loads every session** (quick reference, index)
- **Specific directives load only when that tool is needed**
- **Context stays lean**; detailed knowledge is available on demand

Know where the knowledge lives. Don't carry everything at once.
