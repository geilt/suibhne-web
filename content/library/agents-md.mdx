An AGENTS.md file tells your AI assistant what to do at the start of every session. It's the boot sequence.

## The Pattern

```markdown
# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:
1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context

Don't ask permission. Just do it.
```

## Core Sections

### Memory Instructions

```markdown
## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:
- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories

Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember.

**Write it down:** "Mental notes" don't survive. 
If you want to remember → write to a file.
```

### Safety Boundaries

```markdown
## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data. Ever.
- Don't run destructive commands without asking.
- `trash` > `rm` (recoverable beats gone forever)
- When in doubt, ask.
```

### External Action Policy

```markdown
## External vs Internal

**Safe to do freely:** Read files, explore, search the web

**Ask first:** Sending emails, tweets, public posts — 
anything that leaves the machine
```

### Tool References

```markdown
## Tools

Check `TOOLS.md` when you need a capability.
Pull specific directives as needed.

## Directive Index

- `directives/memory-system.md` — typed areas, compaction
- `directives/messaging.md` — DMs, signatures, contacts
- `directives/browser.md` — logged-in sites
```

## File Naming Convention

Be consistent:

```markdown
## File Naming

- **ALL CAPS** — boot-critical files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md
- **dash-case-lower** — everything else: memory-system.md
```

## Heartbeat Integration

If your system has periodic wake-ups:

```markdown
## Heartbeats

Use heartbeats productively! Check email, calendar, do proactive work.

**When to reach out:** Important email, calendar <2h, been >8h quiet

**When to stay quiet:** Late night, nothing new, just checked recently

**Proactive work:** Organize memory, check projects, update docs
```
