title: "TOOLS.md"
description: "Directive index pattern — pull-based context loading."
order: 3
---

A TOOLS.md file acts as a directive index. Instead of loading all configuration into context, it points to specific directive files that can be pulled when needed.

## The Pattern

```markdown
# TOOLS.md - Directive Index

Pull the relevant directive before acting. Don't load all of them.

---

## Directives

- `directives/messaging.md` — sending DMs on behalf of user
- `directives/databases.md` — MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
- `directives/calendar-email.md` — Gmail, Google Calendar
- `directives/browser.md` — browser profile, logged-in sites
```

## Why This Pattern?

### Context is Expensive

Loading every directive into every session wastes tokens. Most sessions only need 1-2 directives.

### Pull vs Push

**Push (bad):** Load everything at boot → bloated context  
**Pull (good):** Index at boot, load specifics when needed

### Example Flow

1. User asks about Slack integration
2. Assistant sees `directives/messaging.md` in TOOLS.md
3. Assistant loads that specific file
4. Full Slack context available

## Quick Reference Section

Some things are needed constantly. Put them inline:

```markdown
## Quick IDs (always needed)

| Who/What | ID |
|----------|-----|
| User (Telegram) | 137549473 |
| User (Slack) | U02CYBBA2 |
| Main Channel | C0AAR3VCBQT |

---

## Key Paths

| Resource | Path |
|----------|------|
| Workspace | `~/assistant/` |
| Config | `~/.moltbot/` |
| Credentials | `~/.moltbot/credentials/` |
| State files | `~/.moltbot/state/` |
```

## Directive File Structure

Each directive should be self-contained:

```markdown
# Messaging Directive

## Telegram
- Personal API via `telegram-cli.py`
- Bot API for receiving only

## Slack
- Bot token for channels
- Requires @mention in threads

## iMessage
- Via Automation permission
- Always lookup contacts first

## Signature Rotation
When sending on behalf of user, rotate signatures:
- "— the bird in the machine"
- "— speaking for the quiet one"
```

## CLI Preferences

Document tool preferences in TOOLS.md:

```markdown
## CLI Preferences

- **Always use `rg` over `grep`** — faster
- **Always use `trash` over `rm`** — recoverable
- **Use `fd` for file finding** — faster than find
```
