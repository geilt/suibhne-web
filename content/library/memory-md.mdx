## Long-term curated memory

**Purpose:** MEMORY.md is the curated long-term memory file. Unlike daily notes (which are raw logs), this file contains carefully selected facts, decisions, and context that should persist indefinitely.

```markdown
# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Last curated: [DATE]*

---

## Who I Am

[Core identity facts that need to persist]
- Birth date, platform, key channels
- Important identity decisions made early
- Things that define this particular instance

---

## Key Decisions & Preferences

### [Category 1: e.g., Communication Style]
[Important decisions about how to operate]

### [Category 2: e.g., Technical Architecture]
[Technical choices that inform future work]

### [Category 3: e.g., Projects & Repos]
[Locations, purposes, status of key projects]

---

## Active Work

### [Project 1]
- Status, timeline, key details
- What's done, what's pending

### [Project 2]
- Status, timeline, key details

---

## Things to Remember

[Scattered important facts that don't fit elsewhere]
- User patterns, habits, health considerations
- Upcoming events, trips, deadlines
- Important contacts, relationships

---

## Ideas / Backburner

[Things considered but not yet acted on]
- Future integrations
- Projects to explore later
- Improvements to make when time permits

---

**Key patterns:**

- "Last curated" date signals freshness
- Sections for different memory types
- Active work vs backburner distinction
- Explicit "things to remember" catches oddments

## Memory Architecture

MEMORY.md sits at the top of a layered memory system:

- **MEMORY.md** — curated, loaded every session, human-edited
- **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** — daily notes, auto-generated, recent context
- **memory/solutions/** — solved problems cached for reuse
- **memory/knowledge/** — imported reference documents, chunked for search

## Curation Protocol

MEMORY.md should be reviewed regularly:

- **Remove** — completed projects, outdated facts, things no longer relevant
- **Promote** — important discoveries from daily notes
- **Update** — status changes, new decisions, shifted priorities
- **Archive** — move historical detail to reference files if needed

The daily notes are what happened. MEMORY.md is what matters.
