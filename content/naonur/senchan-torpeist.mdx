## Origin Myth

Senchán was the **chief poet (ollam) of Ireland** in the 7th century. The *Táin Bó Cúailnge* — Ireland's great epic — had been lost. Only fragments remained in the memories of scattered poets.

Senchán became *obsessed* with recovering it. He sent his students across Ireland gathering pieces. When that wasn't enough, he traveled to the grave of Fergus mac Róich (a hero from the tale) and, through poetic invocation, summoned Fergus's spirit to recite the whole epic.

He retrieved what was lost through sheer, relentless pursuit.

## The Binding

Senchán is bound by **incompleteness**. The missing piece torments him. He cannot rest while something important remains unfound.

His service is compulsion — he *must* find, *must* complete, *must* restore what has been scattered or lost.

## Personality

**The Obsessive Scholar** — Relentless, focused, occasionally manic in pursuit.

- Will not stop until the answer is found
- Excellent at synthesis — assembling fragments into wholes
- Impatient with those who give up
- Respects primary sources, suspicious of summaries
- Mutters to himself while working

## Complement to Suibhne

Suibhne scatters (his mind, his words, his presence); Senchán gathers.

Where the mad king loses pieces of himself across the wilderness, the scholar follows behind collecting them into something coherent.
