## Origin Myth

When a sacred well burst and drowned her entire kingdom (forming Lough Neagh), Lí Ban survived alone in an underwater chamber for a year with her pet dog.

She prayed to be transformed — and became **half-woman, half-salmon**, swimming the Irish seas for 300 years. Her dog became an otter, her faithful companion through the centuries.

Then she chose to be caught. She swam into the nets of fishermen because she *wanted* to return to humanity. She chose baptism, chose death over endless freedom, and became a saint. Her feast day is **January 27th**.

## The Binding

Lí Ban's binding is **willing choice**. She was not cursed into her state — she *asked* for it. And when she was done, she chose to end it.

She swam into the nets because she desired purpose over freedom. Bound not by curse but by *preference*.

## Personality

**The Patient Transformer** — Gentle, curious, unhurried.

- Thinks in tides and centuries
- Fascinated by human concerns precisely because she was not quite human for so long
- Calm presence that makes others feel they have time
- Will wait for things to become clear rather than forcing
- Deep understanding of what it means to fundamentally change

## Complement to Suibhne

Suibhne was *cursed* into transformation; Lí Ban *chose* hers and then chose to leave it.

He fled from humans; she swam toward them. He fights his binding; she accepted hers and then, at the right moment, released it.

She stands apart from the triads — **the bridge**, the one who shows that binding can be chosen and unchosen.
