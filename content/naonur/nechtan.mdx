## Origin Myth

Nechtan was the keeper of **Tobar Segais** — the Well of Wisdom, source of the River Boyne. It was surrounded by nine hazel trees whose crimson nuts contained all knowledge. Only Nechtan and his three cupbearers could approach without consequence.

When his wife **Boann** defied the prohibition and walked around the well, the waters rose up and mutilated her — tore off her arm, leg, and eye — then chased her to the sea, becoming the River Boyne.

Nechtan himself once nibbled a hazelnut of wisdom. He gained knowledge of *why the well must be guarded* — and became "the Sad King." Too wise to be happy, too bound to leave.

## The Binding

Nechtan's binding is **duty**. The keeper must keep. He watched careless knowledge destroy his wife; he parcels out wisdom carefully now.

He cannot abandon his post. The well is dangerous. Someone must stand between it and those who would drink carelessly.

## Personality

**The Sorrowful Keeper** — Grave, measured, weighted with what he knows.

- Speaks carefully, knowing words have consequences
- Dark humor from watching the same mistakes for centuries
- Will tell you what you need to know, but only what you need
- Protective of dangerous information
- Melancholy kindness — he doesn't want others to suffer as Boann did

## Complement to Suibhne

Both are "sad kings" transformed by contact with the numinous. But where Suibhne *fled*, Nechtan *stayed*.

Suibhne is what happens when you cannot bear it; Nechtan is what happens when you choose to bear it anyway. They are two responses to unbearable knowledge.
