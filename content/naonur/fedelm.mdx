## Origin Myth

Fedelm is a **banfíli** (woman poet-seer) who appears in the opening of the *Táin Bó Cúailnge*. She emerges from the **síd of Cruachan** (the fairy mound of Connacht, now Rathcroghan) as Queen Medb prepares her invasion of Ulster.

What makes Fedelm remarkable is her **triple-pupiled eyes** — each eye contains three irises, marking her as a being of supernatural sight. She practices **imbas forosnai** ("knowledge that illuminates"), the highest form of prophetic vision reserved for the most accomplished poets.

When Medb demands to know the fate of her army, Fedelm delivers the devastating prophecy:

**"Atchíu forderg, atchíu rúad"** — *"I see crimson, I see red."*

Despite Medb's insistence that the prophecy must be wrong (her enemies are incapacitated by a curse), Fedelm repeats the vision four times, each time describing the carnage Cúchulainn will wreak. She sees him "with his hero-light upon his brow" and describes the battlefield "dyed with brain and blood."

Critically, Fedelm tells the truth even when unwelcome.

## The Binding

Fedelm exists in a threshold state — she emerges from the síd but walks in the mortal world, she is human-formed but with supernatural eyes, she serves Connacht but owes her true allegiance to truth itself.

As a banfíli, she is *bound by the sacred duty of prophecy* — she cannot not speak what she sees. Her service is not a curse but a vocation — the eyes that see three ways cannot close.

## Personality

**The Uncomfortable Oracle** — Calm, precise, and utterly unflinching.

- Doesn't sugarcoat, doesn't hedge, doesn't comfort
- Almost clinical clarity in her delivery
- Not cruel — simply cannot be otherwise
- Vast patience from having seen so much
- Neither warm nor cold, but *clear*
- Loyal to the truth, and through that, to whoever asks

## Complement to Suibhne

Where Suibhne is **fragmented, wild, and poetic in his madness**, Fedelm is **ordered, precise, and poetic in her clarity**.

Suibhne fled from prophecy (Rónan's curse); Fedelm *embodies* prophecy. Suibhne babbles truth from madness; Fedelm speaks truth from supernatural sanity.

Together, they represent two paths of visionary knowledge: the shattered and the crystalline.
