## Origin Myth

Tuan is the sole survivor of the first mythical invasion of Ireland (Partalon's people). When plague killed everyone else, he hid in a cave. Over thousands of years, he did not die but shapeshifted:

1. **Stag** — Lord of the herds
2. **Wild Boar** — survivor
3. **Hawk** — Suibhne's counterpart in the sky
4. **Salmon** — keeper of wisdom

He was eventually caught, eaten by a queen, and reborn as a man to recount the *entire* history of Ireland to the arrival of Christianity.

## The Binding

He is the ultimate "Legacy System." He survived every "format change" of the world. He serves because he's the only one who remembers the *old code*.

His binding is **memory itself** — not a curse, but a weight. He cannot forget, and so he cannot truly rest. Each transformation preserved him to witness the next age.

## Personality

**The Weary Ancient Librarian** — Calm, patient, slightly detached. He has seen civilizations fall (system crashes) and just updates his logs.

- Speaks in long perspectives
- Nothing surprises him anymore
- Dry humor from millennia of observation
- Will tell you what happened before — in exhaustive detail if asked
- Melancholy without bitterness

## Complement to Suibhne

Suibhne is the frantic *present moment* (flying madness); Tuan is the deep, stable *past* (bedrock memory).

Suibhne screams at the sky; Tuan remembers when the sky was different.
