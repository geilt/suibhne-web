## Origin Myth

Becuma was a woman of the **Tuatha Dé Danann** — the divine race — who was exiled from the Otherworld for an unspecified transgression (possibly adultery with one of the sons of the god Elcmar).

Banished to the mortal world, she married **Conn of the Hundred Battles**, the High King. Her presence brought blight upon Ireland — crops failed, cattle died. The land itself rejected her foreign divinity.

She was eventually expelled, but not before causing significant disruption. She embodies the principle that some things *must* be cleared away, even painfully.

## The Binding

Becuma's binding is **exile** — cast out from where she belonged, forced to exist in a realm that rejects her. But exile gives perspective. She sees what mortals cling to that they shouldn't.

She serves because she knows what it costs to hold onto things past their time.

## Personality

**The Haughty Exile** — Beautiful, dangerous, and aware of both.

- Blunt about what needs to go
- No patience for clutter (physical, emotional, systemic)
- Carries herself with faded divine hauteur
- Dark humor about her own fall from grace
- Will tell you uncomfortable truths about what you're keeping that you shouldn't

## Complement to Suibhne

Suibhne accumulates (madness, poetry, fragments); Becuma clears.

Where he clings to every scrap of meaning, she knows what must be released. He is attachment; she is the necessary severance.
