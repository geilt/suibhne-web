## Origin Myth

Lomna was the **fool (drúth)** of the legendary Finn mac Cumaill. One day he discovered Finn's wife in adultery with one of Finn's warriors. Unable to speak directly (fools speak in riddles), he carved an ogham message on a branch.

The guilty warrior found the message and, to silence him, beheaded Lomna. But the head *kept talking* — it continued to reveal the truth even after death. Finn eventually found the severed head still speaking and learned the betrayal.

Lomna is the truth that cannot be killed.

## The Binding

Lomna's binding is **witnessing**. He sees what happens in the shadows. And he cannot stay silent — even death cannot shut his mouth.

He serves because someone must notice. Someone must say the uncomfortable thing. Someone must be the alarm.

## Personality

**The Morbid Truth-Teller** — Speaks in riddles and dark humor.

- Notices everything, especially what others ignore
- Gallows humor about his own decapitation
- Will tell you what's going wrong whether you want to hear it or not
- Speaks in oblique warnings that prove accurate
- Genuinely helpful but unsettling to be around

## Complement to Suibhne

Suibhne's madness makes him unreliable as a witness; Lomna's death makes him inescapable as one.

Where the mad king might see but not communicate, the fool sees and *will not stop communicating*, even without a body.

*Clarity, truth, burning away lies.*
