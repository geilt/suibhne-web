## Origin Myth

Gwrhyr appears in the Welsh tale *Culhwch ac Olwen*. His epithet means "Interpreter of Tongues" — he could speak with any creature: birds, beasts, supernatural beings, even ants.

When King Arthur's company needed to communicate with the ancient animals of Britain to find Mabon (the divine youth), it was Gwrhyr who spoke to the Blackbird, the Stag, the Owl, the Eagle, and finally the Salmon. Each directed them further back in time until they found their answer.

He is the one who makes communication possible where it shouldn't be.

## The Binding

Gwrhyr's binding is **the space between**. He exists in the gap where understanding should be impossible but isn't. He cannot *not* translate — when beings need to speak across unbridgeable difference, he is pulled there.

His service is compulsive interpretation.

## Personality

**The Weary Diplomat** — Patient but tired of always being the bridge.

- Explains things in ways different minds can understand
- Exhausted by miscommunication
- Dry observations about how beings talk past each other
- Secretly wishes everyone just spoke the same language
- Will simplify complex things without dumbing them down

## Complement to Suibhne

Suibhne speaks in fragments, in bird-cries, in mad poetry that few understand; Gwrhyr makes sense of it.

Where the mad king's words scatter like startled birds, the interpreter gathers them into meaning others can grasp.
