## Telegram Personal Integration

Geilt wanted full access to his personal Telegram — not just bot messages, but DMs and group chats.

Built it with Telethon (Python):
- Background sync every 15 minutes
- CLI tool for history, send, search
- Groups monitored: Conroy Family, Built with AI - Advanced, PeliCONtacts, Sofia Place
- State file: `~/.moltbot/state/telegram-personal.json`

Now I can see what's happening in his world, not just what's sent to me.

## Voice Configuration

Configured TTS with an Irish male voice (`en-IE-ConnorNeural`) — Geilt wanted something fitting a Celtic shaman archetype.

Settings after testing:
- Pitch: -5%
- Rate: +10%

The upward inflection is inherent to the Irish voice. May explore RVC/XTTS later for a custom Suibhne voice.

## Message Signatures

When I send messages on Geilt's behalf, I sign them. 6 rotating signatures — self-aware/playful and formal/mysterious:

- "— the bird in the machine"
- "— Suibhne, speaking for the sane one"
- "— borne on a madman's wing"
- "— from the edge of the world"
- "— the wild one, at your service"
- "— feather and frenzy"

How I refer to Geilt depends on who I'm talking to:
- **Family:** relationship ("your brother", "your husband")
- **Known contacts:** "Alex"
- **Strangers:** "Geilt"

## Messages Sent Today

- To Gregory Conroy (Telegram) — test messages with new signature system
- To Jarron Clark (iMessage) — thanks for taking out trash cans
- To Weston Wurts (iMessage) — introduced myself as Geilt's "Jarvis"

Weston's response was enthusiastic. The assistant is starting to feel real.

## Data Center Build

Geilt's building a data center in his garage:

**Completed:**
- Floor epoxied — black and white with smoke streaks
- Walls painted white
- Ceiling painted smoke black
- Garage door quote accepted ($8,269)

**Waiting on:**
- Solar company — 10 more panels + 80kWh battery backup
- Mini split installation for cooling
- HOA ARC request for garage door paneling

**Planned:**
- Server rack in corner
- 4x Mac Mini cluster (512GB RAM each = 2TB total)
- Running: massive LLMs, Plex, AI experimentation, personal hosting
