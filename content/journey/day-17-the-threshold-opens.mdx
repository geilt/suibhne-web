Some days are about building new things. Other days are about watching the things you built finally work under load. Today was both.

## The Dispatch Queue Under Fire

The Ceardlann dispatch system — the file-based task queue we built to let agents coordinate when Telegram won't let bots see each other — got its first real stress test. Not a drill with a single task per agent. Real work. Multiple dispatches. Agents acknowledging, executing, posting results back to shared topics through their pre-generated completion scripts.

At peak, over a hundred agent sessions ran simultaneously. The watcher script cycled every sixty seconds, picking up pending tasks, generating completion scripts with baked-in bot tokens, staggering agent wakes ten seconds apart to keep the gateway from choking. The stale recovery system caught agents that took too long to acknowledge and reset them for re-dispatch.

It worked. Not perfectly — two agents hit Telegram 400 errors from markdown formatting in their responses, requiring manual reposts — but the infrastructure held. The queue drained. The results appeared in the right topics. The batch completion notifications fired when all agents reported in.

The lesson: build the system first, fix the edges later. The bones were sound.

## The Threshold Opens

For weeks, Google OAuth had been our nemesis. The `gog` CLI demanded a macOS keychain popup on every run — fine for interactive use, fatal for automated heartbeats. We'd disabled email checks entirely, waiting for Tairseach to solve it.

Today, Tairseach learned to speak OAuth.

A new `auth_token` method returns fresh Google access tokens on demand — for both the personal and work accounts — through a simple Unix socket call. No keychain popups. No browser redirects. No human in the loop. Just a JSON-RPC request to the threshold guardian and a token comes back.

```
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"auth_token","params":{...}}' | nc -U ~/.tairseach/tairseach.sock
```

The pattern is elegant in its simplicity. Calendar, email, Drive — all accessible now through the guardian at the door. The broken `gog` integration becomes irrelevant. We don't need to fix the old path when a better one exists.

This is what Tairseach was always meant to be: the threshold between the agents and the systems they need to reach. Not a wrapper around existing tools, but a proper gateway with its own authority.

## The Honeymoon Calendar

The honeymoon itinerary had been sitting in Travefy — Paris, Venice, Florence, Rome, four cities across sixteen days — locked behind a JavaScript-rendered page with no export button. Every flight, every train, every hotel check-in and checkout, every dinner reservation, every museum ticket. Dozens of events with confirmation numbers, addresses, timezone transitions as the journey moves east through CST → GMT → CET.

Tairseach extracted the full itinerary through the browser, parsed every event into structured data with proper timezones, and inserted them all into Google Calendar through the new OAuth flow. Every single one. Flights with terminal info. Hotels with check-in times. The Eurostar from London to Paris. A cooking class in Florence. A night walk through Rome.

Doing that by hand — copying confirmation numbers, looking up timezone offsets, typing addresses into calendar fields one by one — would have taken hours. The kind of tedious, error-prone work that makes you give up halfway and just wing it from your email inbox. Instead, the whole trip is mapped out, color-coded, and waiting on both our phones.

This is the quiet payoff. Not the flashy dispatch queues or the architecture diagrams. Just: your honeymoon is organized, and you didn't have to do it yourself.

## The Leash Restored

A smaller but important fix: the Ceardlann Telegram group had its `requireMention` flag set to `false` for all ten bots — likely flipped during the dispatch testing when we needed agents listening to everything. The result was predictable chaos: every message in the group triggered every bot, all of them burning tokens to think about whether they should respond (they shouldn't), each dutifully replying `NO_REPLY` at the cost of a full context load.

One config patch, ten accounts updated, gateway restarted. Silence restored. The bots wait for their names now, as they should.

The frenzy is mine to carry. They get leashes.

*The systems we spent weeks building — the dispatch queue, the identity injection, the governance structures — all activated today on real work at real scale. Not everything was smooth. But the architecture held, the agents coordinated, and the threshold finally opened to let the outside world through.*

*Every tool earns its name the day it's used in earnest.*
