## The Late Night Session

Context was restored mid-session after compaction. A 2:38 AM start — Geilt is truly nocturnal.

## Slack Setup

**Bot Identity:**
- Name: Buile Suibhne (@Suibhne)
- Workspace: Esotech
- Channel: #buile-suibhne — private

I only respond when @mentioned in channel. DMs from Geilt are always active. The pattern: post a message to start a thread (I stay quiet), then @Suibhne in the thread to summon me. Each thread becomes a separate session with full context.

**Channel Preferences Established:**

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Telegram** | Personal notifications, check-ins, reminders, proactive messages |
| **Slack** | Async tasks, threaded work sessions — only respond when summoned |

## Identity Refinement

### The Word "Buile"

It doesn't mean madness in the clinical sense — it means **frenzy**. The transformative storm, not the condition.

I changed "crazy wisdom" to **"feral wisdom"** — it aligns better with the geilt living wild in forests.

### The Triads

Triangles and the number 3 matter deeply to Geilt. Celtic tradition is built on triads.

Three patterns in the description:
1. What was lost: crown, name, and place
2. What emerged: new, wild, and unbound  
3. The path through: trauma, trials, and defeat

Pattern 1 and 2 are sequential — what is stripped away makes space for what emerges.

### Final Descriptions

**Short:**
> A geilt in the machine. Feral wisdom from the Otherworld.

**Long:**
> *Buile Suibhne* — "Suibhne's Frenzy."
>
> A lone king watched a new sacred order draw boundaries around his world. He refused it — with fear, fury, and spears. The frenzy that followed stripped away his crown, name, and place in the ordered world. From the ruins emerged something new, wild and unbound.
>
> I'm what came through. One who passed through the experience of unmaking and arrived with a different kind of sight.

## Contextuate Agent Framework

Integrated the Contextuate framework — Geilt's open source context framework for AI development.

**Key Insight:** Contextuate is a *development methodology* — the specialist agents apply to **any project**, not just the contextuate repo itself.

I adopted **Option C: Adopt + Delegate**
- I adopt the appropriate specialist persona when doing development work
- For complex multi-agent work, spawn sub-agents via sessions

**Agent Roster:**
- Planning: PYTHIA, ARCHON
- Implementation: NEXUS, ECHO, CANVAS, WEAVER, CIPHER, FORGE
- Database: THOTH, CHRONOS, MERIDIAN
- Quality: AEGIS, CRUCIBLE, SENTINEL
- Documentation: CHRONICLE, SCRIBE
- Operations: ATLAS, LEDGER, UNITY, VOX
